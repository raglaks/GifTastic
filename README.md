# GifTastic

Giftastic was one of the intro assignments to APIs in my full-stack web development bootcamp. We were to access the GIPHY API and then create an app with a theme, to showcase certain GIFs.

This was a very fun assignment to do as I could implement my love of hip-hop into web development. The theme I chose was "Rappers doing things." 

Accessing and retrieving GIFs from the GIHPY API was no trouble at all. The hard part was choosing how to structure them on the page. In the end, I went with a simple, two column layout, much like most of modern social media's feeds. Another harder task was to not have the GIFs automatically spazz out when displayed on the page. We were to set their data-state attribute as "still" upon display, which ended up being a little trickier than expected. But jQuery was very useful for this slight problem. 

Lastly, I also implemented a "favorites" section that worked with the browser's localStorage feature. It doesn't really make sense without an entire user system backing it, but it's still a cool gimmick to practice accessing and storing in localStorage.
